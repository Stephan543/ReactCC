# Building a full stack task tracker in react.js

[LiveTaskTracker.heroku.com](https://quiet-beach-94017.herokuapp.com/)

## How?
Used Brad Traversy's react crash course to learn. 

I put in almost 4-5x the courses recording time because I really wanted to play around and understand the foundations of functional components in react. 

## What did I learn?
1. True dynamic pages...
2. How recyclable react components can be
3. How to deploy an efficient build and serve build
4. Getting familiar with Node.js runntime during development 
5. Developing a backend with npm's JSON server (GET/PUT requests)


## Future Learnings?
1. Study/ Complete more backend based projects using Express.js
3. Develop my react skills by completing more projects
